	  <div class="col-lg-8"><p>I grew up in a very musical family. My father played saxophone with a "band of buddies" from his college days, and he is now the local high school band teacher. My mother is the singer in the family, and she is a regular lead performer in musicals with our community theater. Needless to say, my three siblings and I all took music lessons. But even though I was the one who never could settle on a favorite instrument, I'm the only one who went into the music buisness!</p>

 
<p>
Early on, music became my thing. I could name any song on the radio and tell you not only who was singing it, but who wrote it and when. At my senior prom, I was at the turntable more that I was on the dance floor.</p>

 
<p>
During college, I supplemented my income by DJ-ing fraternity and sorority-sponsered parties and other campus events. Eventually, I landed a job with a radio station. That was cool, but I missed being part of all the action and fun that people were having at a party rocking with music. Let's face it, being a DJ is the closest thing to being a rock star without having to play an instrument!
  </p>
 

<p>So, I started DJ Turntable, and I haven't stopped spinning since. I love what I do and so will you.</p></div>
